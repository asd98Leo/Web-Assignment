There are laws against the making, using, or selling of drugs.

            How Drugs Work
          </p>
          <p>
            Drugs act like poison! The more you consume, the most you experience its effect. A little amount is enough to stimulate your senses and will help to speed you up. A bigger amount will act as a sedative, which will slow you down. A much bigger amount will act as poison that will eventually kill you. Any drug will have the same effect on the body. Only the amount of consumption to achieve the effect will differ.

Some drugs can have a direct affect on the mind. They can completely change the user’s perception of the world around him or her. As a result of this, the person may behave oddly, irrationally or inappropriately. Drugs will block all sensations, whether desirable or unwanted. Along with providing short-term help in relieving pain, they will wipe out the ability and alertness of one’s thinking.

How Drugs Work

Medicines are drugs that intend to change something about your body. They help in better working of the body. They are often necessary to help you from disease and disorders. However, they are drugs! They can have a negative effect on the body with increased consumption. Keeping the intake under control is extremely important. You need to use them as prescribed by the doctor.

            To remember something, the mind needs to be very fast as information is quickly transferred. Drugs tend to blur memory by causing blank spots. Trying to remember something will become impossible through these blank spots. Drugs will slow down thinking and make a person feel stupid. Since the person can’t think straight he/she will experience failures in life. As life seems to get harder, consuming more drugs will become a solution.
